## Building & Commands

You'll notice the `package.json` scripts are very simple.
That's because the build instructions were getting complex, so they were moved into a [`Makefile`](https://github.com/dfee/rbx/blob/master/Makefile).

By running the `make help` command in the root of a cloned repo, you'll see the available options (including building, testing, etc.)

### Testing

The robust way to test is with `make test`, which will:

1. run `tslint` to verify the code
2. run `jest` for unit and snapshot testing
3. output a coverage report

For convenience, you'll often want to use `npx jest the/file/to/test.ts` to run tests on a particular file.

### Building

The general way to build is to use `make`, which will:

1. compile the code into _ECMAScript 6_ with `tsc` into the '/dist' directory
2. compile that _ES6_ code into _UMD_ (_Universal Module Definition_) code using `rollup` (as `rbx.umd.js` extension).
3. copy and compile the _SASS_ code into _CSS_, output to the `/dist` directory
4. copy and modify the `package.json` so that it can be published to _npm_ without requiring imports from a root directory (i.e. `import { DEFAULTS } from 'rbx/base/helpers/variables';` rather than `import { DEFAULTS } from 'rbx/dist/base/helpers/variables`).

### Publish

**Important:** do not use `npm publish` to publish the code to _npm_.
Rather, use `make publish` which will publish the build result in `/dist`.

## Contributing and releasing

### Authoring a Pull Request (contributing)

To participate in development, here is the contribution process:

- [ ] fork `rbx` on GitHub
- [ ] `git clone` (create the repo locally)
- [ ] `git checkout master`
- [ ] `git pull` (updating `master`)
- [ ] `git checkout -b <new-branch>` (create _feature_ or _bug_ branch)
- [ ] implement code changes
- [ ] update documentation as appropriate (using `make docs-dev`)
- [ ] `make test` (for linting, unit tests, etc.)
- [ ] `make examples-test` (for ensuring that the demos still work)
- [ ] `make` (generating updated `size-snapshot.json`)
- [ ] `git add` and `git commit`
- [ ] `git push origin <new-branch>`
- [ ] ensure CI coverage passes
- [ ] open pull request to master repo (`dfee/rbx`)

### After the Pull Request (releasing)

After an acceptable pull request is received, here is the release process:

- [ ] `git checkout master`
- [ ] `git pull`
- [ ] `git merge <new-branch>`
- [ ] `npm version` (update package version).
- [ ] `git push master` and `git push origin <version-tag>`
- [ ] ensure CI coverage passes (again)
- [ ] `make` (create a new release with updated version)
- [ ] `make publish` (publish to NPM)
- [ ] `make docs` and `make docs-publish` (optional, build new docs for GitHub Pages)
- [ ] publish release on GitHub (find tag, make release)
- [ ] `git branch -d <new-branch>` (delete `<new-branch>` locally)
- [ ] `git push --delete origin <new-branch>` (delete `<new-branch>` on remote)
